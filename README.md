# codebook_02

Running codebook:

- In the root directory, run `npm run start`
- In packages/cli/dist, run `node index.js serve`

Alternatively simple run `npx simple-codebook serve`

## TODO

- Would like to write cells into a file in a more user-friendly format than just as JSON strings
- Make code editor height adjust as more code gets added to it.
- Add default notes and code to make it easier for a user to start using the codebook
